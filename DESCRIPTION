Description: Summarizes key information about statistical list output
    in tidy tibbles, spun off and expanded from the 'broom' package.
    Methods of the generic functions tidy() and glance() are provided for lists,
    which are often returned by statistical analysis functions without S3 class
    attributes. These methods inspect lists for recognized structure and,
    if found, return tidy summaries.
    Intended as a possible solution to the challenge of maintaining the
    ever-expanding 'broom' package.
